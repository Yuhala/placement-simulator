-The folders contain the simulation results of different traces using different scheduling algorithms
	-Minimum memory server first algorithm (results for these simulations are found in the min folder)
	-Contiguous memory server first algorithm (results for these simulations are found in the contiguous folder)
	-Maximum memory server first algorithm (results for these simulations are found in the max folder)
-

-All simulation results are written to csv files

-The schema for the csv results files is as follows:

	=========================================================================
	|Column |  Value							|
	=========================================================================
	|1	|Number of VMs							|	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------						
	|2	|Total number of servers					|
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------						
	|3	|Total number of servers used					|
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	|4	|Percentage of contiguous memory vms at the end of the simulation|	
	=========================================================================
